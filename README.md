# Evaporator

An evaporator is a device which turns the liquid form of a substance into its gaseous or vapour form. This is a widely used process and there are many applications for it...


# Uses:

One kind of evaporator is a radiator coil used in a closed, compressor-driven circulation of a liquid coolant. This is called an air-conditioning system (A/C) or refrigeration system to allow a compressed cooling chemical, such as R-22 (Freon) or R-410A, to evaporate/vaporize from liquid to gas within the system while absorbing heat from the enclosed cooled area in the process, for example a refrigerator or air conditioner. This works in the closed A/C or refrigeration system with a condenser radiator coil that exchanges the heat from the coolant, such as into the ambient environment.

A different kind of evaporator can be used for heating and possibly boiling a product containing a liquid to cause the liquid to evaporate from the product.

The appropriate process can be used to remove water or other liquids from liquid based mixtures. The process of evaporation is widely used to concentrate liquid foods, such as soup or make concentrated milk called "condensed milk" done by evaporating water from the milk. In the concentration process, the goal of evaporation is to vaporize most of the water from a solution which contains the desired product.

An evaporator/evaporative-process can be used for separating liquid chemicals as well as to salvage solvents.

In the case of desalination of sea water or in Zero Liquid Discharge plants, the reverse purpose applies; evaporation removes the desirable drinking water from the undesired solute/product, salt.

One of the most important applications of evaporation is in the food and beverage industry. Foods or beverages that need to last for a considerable amount of time or need to have certain consistency, like coffee, go through an evaporation step during processing.

In the pharmaceutical industry, the evaporation process is used to eliminate excess moisture, providing an easily handled product and improving product stability. Preservation of long-term activity or stabilization of enzymes in laboratories are greatly assisted by the evaporation process.

Another example of evaporation is in the recovery of sodium hydroxide in kraft pulping. Cutting down waste-handling cost is another major reason for large companies to use evaporation applications. Legally, all producers of waste must dispose of waste using methods compatible with environmental guidelines; these methods are costly. By removing moisture through vaporization, industry can greatly reduce the amount of waste product that must be processed...
